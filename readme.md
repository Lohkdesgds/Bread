*Bread is the bot you didn't know you needed! Now on version **2.0**, it uses the latest and greatest features of Discord using [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP)!*

<hr>

### Who is this for?

‚áí *Anyone in need of a bot that do **statistics**, **leveling** (with anti-spam algorithms), **poll** (using modals, custom reactions and easy to use interface), **copy/paste** (you can reference messages everywhere!) and more needs this on your server! Keep track of your users, give them roles on join, let them get roles themselves, know how many messages, commands and attachments a user sent on your server versus globally and so on with ease!*

### You said leveling? How is that? Why is this superior?

‚áí *Other bots don't care about spam. Most bots just count up to 60 and give the next user the points. This is very likely to result in flood or timed messages by the users. **Bread is different**: it uses time per user and per guild, and it considers if the user is spamming alone in the chat or not! A random user will never level up by themself!*

### How do I add the bot?

‚áí *Easy: [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=797612182610378835&permissions=139922368576&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and voil√†. Unlike other bots, we won't require you full Administrator permission. This is very dumb and bad.*

## Common issues

#### "I can't setup the bot" / "the bot said I'm not administrator", what do I do?

‚áí *In this update one thing changed: All commands are global by default. This means I had to do some way to tell if the user is administrator or not. This is done by role check. Please make sure you have at least **one** role with Administrator rights **and** you've sent one message prior to the command. Sometimes the cache is created **after** a new message. You can force a cache update (if needed) by showing your user info (right click on you, then go to **Apps** and click **Show info of this user**).*

#### When I create a poll the bot won't add the reactions!

‚áí *First be sure that the bot has the **permission** to **add** reactions. It needs that. Second, check if the format of your emojis is correct. It is supposed to be **emoji;emoji;emoji** (no spaces, just emojis with **;** in between). If after all that you still have problems, please consider checking the [support server](https://discord.gg/eQfnXdTH6f) on the bot's bio.*

#### The bot is offline / not responding?

‚áí *Sometimes there are updates or maybe even bugs. Computers are not perfect. If you want to be 100% up to date, join the [support server](https://discord.gg/eQfnXdTH6f) and keep an eye on the Bread category! There's a chance the bot status tells you what is happening.*

#### Where is the language options?

‚áí *It's been fun trying to work with multiple languages, and I really appreciate all the help to add other languages I don't know. Unfortunalety this was a very slow and intensive thing that didn't really add much to the bot. Also, Discord is working on a per-user language support, so we **will** have this in the future again, but it's not worth it to keep as it was before.*

## The end!

‚áí *If you have any suggestion, please don't hesitate joining the [support server](https://discord.gg/eQfnXdTH6f)! It is open, free, no charge, won't bite, and plus: you get the information before everyone else! Plus again: you can see other projects I'm currently working on!*
